Dosbox-Font
===========

The Pixel-Font is taken from [Dosbox](www.dosbox.com), which should be no problem, as it is GPLv2.

Dosbox is available unter www.dosbox.com (and in the sourcecode you can find the Font).

I used only the "pixels" but provide a completely different format in the *.fnt-file.
